This package provides the `eulerpx' font, which started as a hybrid of multiple 
other font packages, notably eulervm and newpxmath. Its purpose is twofold:
 (1) To use the eulervm symbols for greek and latin letters, but the newpxmath
     font for braces and brackets, and the text font for digits and operators;
 (2) To make it easy to change between a sans and serif font for the digits and
     operators, so that the font can be used seamlessly in documents using both.
This package was put together with the intent to use it with the Palatino and
Optima fonts (newpxtext and classico), but may work with other combinations too.

To use the package, add this to your preamble:

   \usepackage{eulerpx}

You may use the \sfmath and \rmmath macros to switch between serif and sans fonts
for the digits and operators. For instance, if you use a KOMA-Script class, you
can put the following in your preamble to switch all footnotes to a sans font:

  \addtokomafont{footnote}{\sffamily\sfmath}

Note that in contrast to the eulervm package, bold math characters are accessed
through the \mathbf macro. If the option `utf8' is provided, the package will 
also declare the Greek unicode range; i.e., if the package is included with

  \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
  \usepackage[utf8]{eulerpx}

then you may write your equations in the form $α+β$ instead of $\alpha+\beta$.

  v0.1: Initial eulerpx package created



Credits

This package is based on the following existing packages:
 - The package `newpxmath' is loaded as a base font, to provide parentheses, 
   brackets, relations, \mathbb, etc. This was done because in the authors'
   opinion, the newpx brackets are much more aesthetic than the Euler ones.
 - The Euler symbols for latin and greek letters are then loaded. This part
   is based directly on the `eulervm' package, but it has been modified to 
   not use e.g. Euler digits and brackets. For maintainability, the support
   for other encodings than T1 has been removed.
 - The \sfmath implementation is inspired by the `sansmath' package. I have,
   however, modified this such that the macro does not alter the font used 
   for mathematical symbols, only the font for operators and numerals. This
   is useful for people that want to consistently use the Euler symbols in
   *all* environments, and only typeset operators and digits in sans/serif.
