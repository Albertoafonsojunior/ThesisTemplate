  This paper was written during my Master's degree, and is therefore not formally a part of my PhD.
  However, since the topic is relevant for this thesis, and my later papers build directly upon the results obtained herein, I chose to include it here for completeness.

  My contribution to the paper was to derive the Riccati-parametrized equations and linearized Usadel equations together with S.~Jacobsen.
  In addition, I performed all critical temperature calculations, and wrote the appendices.
