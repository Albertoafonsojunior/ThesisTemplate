  This paper was written during my Master's degree, and is therefore not formally a part of my PhD.
  However, since the topic is relevant for this thesis, and two later papers build directly upon the results obtained herein, I chose to include it here for completeness.

  My contribution to the paper was to derive the Riccati-parametrized equations and linearized Usadel equations together with S.~Jacobsen.
  In addition, I performed all critical temperature calculations, and wrote the appendices.
  S.~Jacobsen performed all the density of states calculations.
  J.~Linder suggested and supervised the project, and all authors contributed to the discussion of the results.
