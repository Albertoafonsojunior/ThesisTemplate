\section{Interpolation}
When solving the nonequilibrium problem, the problem was formulated as:
\begin{align}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \BC{H}\phantom{'} \\
    \BC{H}' 
  \end{pmatrix}'
  =
  -
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \B{0} & 
    \B{1} \\
    \BC{M}^{-1} \big[ (\partial_z\BC{M}) + \BC{Q} \big] &
    \BC{M}^{-1} \big[ (\partial_z\BC{Q}) + \BC{K} \big]
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \BC{H}\phantom{'} \\
    \BC{H}' 
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}
One nice thing about this formulation, is that we have an explicit expression for the Jacobian $\B{J}$ of the problem, i.e. the $16\times16$ proportionality matrix in the equation above, which does not depend on the distribution function~$\BC{H}$.

However, each of the matrices $\BC{M}$, $\BC{Q}$, $\BC{K}$ are functions of the equilibrium propagators $\U{G}^R$ and $\U{G}^A$, which again depend on position~$z$.
This means that the Jacobian~$J(z)$ is position-dependent, and can only be explicitly calculated at the discretized positions where the equilibrium propagators are known.
The problem is that the differential equation solver needs to be able to calculate the Jacobian at arbitrary positions, which means that some form of interpolation is needed here.
My first approach was a simple linear interpolation.
That was unstable and crashed, since the numerical solver is sensitive to the \emph{derivative} of the Jacobian, which in this case becomes discontinuous.
My next approach was to try using the \texttt{pchip}-library (Piecewise Hermitian Cubic Interpolation) that I've used for cubic interpolations of e.g. the gap in the past.
However, this library only operates on scalar functions, and calling it $16^2 = 256$ separate times to interpolate the Jacobian at each point turned out to be really inefficient.
My solution was therefore to implement such a cubic matrix interpolator myself, in order to speed up the nonequilibrium solver.

\section{Boundary condition}
As we showed in the manuscript with Tom [Eq.~(31--32)], the boundary conditions at a spin-active interface can be written as follows:
\begin{align}
  \BC{J}_a &= \BC{C}_{aa} \BC{H}_a - \BC{C}_{ab} \BC{H}_b \\
  \BC{J}_b &= \BC{C}_{bb} \BC{H}_b - \BC{C}_{ba} \BC{H}_a 
\end{align}
The minus-sign on the right-hand sides appears because this is derived from a commutator. 
This sign is just a convenient convention -- in comparison to Tom's notation, this gets rid of the signs in Eq.~(36) of the arXiv manuscript.
Note that both the boundary conditions above follow the same pattern:
\begin{align}
  \BC{J} &= \BC{C} \BC{H} - \BC{C}'\BC{H}'
\end{align}
Here, the unprimed quantities refer to ``this'' side of the interface -- i.e. where the current $\BC{J}$ is calculated -- while the primed ones refer to ``the other'' side.

If we for now ignore spin-orbit coupling, we can substitute $\BC{J} = \BC{M}\partial\BC{H} + \BC{QH}$ into the equation above, and thus get the boundary condition:
\begin{align}
  \BC{M}\partial\BC{H} + \BC{QH} = \BC{C} \BC{H} - \BC{C}'\BC{H}'
\end{align}
This is equivalent to Eq.~(40) in the arXiv manuscript, but fixes a sign error in the $\BC{Q}$-term. 
This boundary condition can also be written in matrix form:
\begin{align}
  \BC{M}\partial\BC{H} + [\BC{Q}-\BC{C}]\BC{H} + \BC{C}'\BC{H}' = 0
\end{align}
Finally, this can be rewritten in matrix form as:
\begin{align}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \BC{Q}-\BC{C} & \BC{M} \\
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \BC{H} \\
    \partial\BC{H}
  \end{pmatrix}
  +
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \BC{C}' & 0 \\
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \BC{H} \\
    \partial\BC{H}
  \end{pmatrix}
  &= 0
\end{align}
In other words: if we define the 16-element state vectors $\B{u} = [\BC{H}; \partial\BC{H}]$ and $\B{u}\ = [\BC{H}'; \partial\BC{H}']$, and the $8\times16$ matrices $\B{A} = [\BC{Q}-\BC{C}, \BC{M} ]$ and $\B{B} = [-\BC{C}', 0]$ that operate on these, then the boundary condition can be written:
\begin{align}
  \B{A}\B{u} - \B{B}\B{u}' = 0 .
\end{align}
\clearpage
These boundary conditions have a number of nice properties:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 
    The coefficients $\B{A}$ and $\B{B}$ only depend on equilibrium properties.
    This means that they only have to be calculated once, and evaluating the boundary condition is reduced to a simple matrix multiplication.
  \item 
    The equation has the form $\B{F}(\B{u},\B{u}') = 0$.
    This is perfect since I use a numerical solver that works by minimizing a user-specified residual.
  \item
    The Jacobian $J_{ij} = \partial F_i/\partial u_j$ of the boundary condition is simply the matrix $\B{A}$.
    Since I use a numerical solver that can use the Jacobian of the boundary condition to speed up convergence, this is quite useful.
\end{itemize}
In the case of transparent boundary conditions, the problem may again be formulated in the same way as above, but with Jacobians $\B{A} = \B{B} = [\B{1},\B{0}]$.
